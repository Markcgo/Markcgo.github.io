<span style="font-size: 24px;">Glad to see you!</span>

I'm a fourth year undergradute student from College of Materials Science and Engineering,Fuzhou University.<!-- (https://www.fzu.edu.cn) -->Then I'm going to start my graduate study in Wuhan National Laboratory For Optoelectronics,Huazhong University of Science and Technology.<!-- (https://www.hust.edu.cn) -->

My future research will focus on the perovskite solar cells.But I don't know much of the field. Still learning...
Except my research project, I desire to learn some skills of software development using Swift.

I love language. 日本語を勉強しています

I want to be an optical engineer(Virtual Reality) or a chip design engineer or a university professor. Now I'm exploring my possibilities.

followings are the courses I'm studying
