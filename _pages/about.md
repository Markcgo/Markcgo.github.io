I'm a first year gradute student from College of Optical and Electronic Information, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.<!-- (https://oei.hust.edu.cn/) -->I'm in Wuhan National Laboratory For Optoelectronics. Contact me if you want visit.<!-- (https://www.hust.edu.cn) -->

My future research will focus on the mesoscopic perovskite solar cells.But I don't know much of the field. Still learning...
Except my research project, I desire to learn some skills of Computer Science.

I love language. 日本語を勉強しています

I want to be an optical engineer(Because I think Apple Vision Pro is amazing) or a chip design engineer or a university professor. Now I'm exploring my possibilities.

Followings are the courses I'm studying：（contact me if you are interested）
